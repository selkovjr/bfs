# BFS database and front end

This is the beginning of a modelling effort to launch a web-based interface to
the Bird Flu Sampling database.

The database runs under **PostgreSQL 9.2**. The interface is built with **Mojito** and
it connects to the backend through **pgrest**.

## Required environment:

```
export NODE_PATH="./node_modules:/usr/local/lib/node:/usr/local/lib/node_modules"
```
